What’s the difference between data mining and data warehousing?
 
Data mining is the process of finding patterns in a given data set. 
These patterns can often provide meaningful and insightful data to 
whoever is interested in that data. Data mining is used today in a 
wide variety of contexts – in fraud detection, as an aid in marketing
campaigns, and even supermarkets use it to study their consumers.

Data warehousing can be said to be the process of centralizing or 
aggregating data from multiple sources into one common repository  


If you’ve ever used a credit card, then you may know that credit card
companies will alert you when they think that your credit card is being 
fraudulently used by someone other than you. This is a perfect example 
of data mining – credit card companies have a history of your purchases 
the past and know geographically where those purchases have been made. 
If all of a sudden some purchases are made in a city far from where you live,
the credit card companies are put on alert to a possible fraud since their
data mining shows that you don’t normally make purchases in that city. 
Then, the credit card company can disable your card for that transaction or 
just put a flag on your card for suspicious activity.

Another interesting example of data mining is how one grocery store in the 
USA used the data it collected on it’s shoppers to find patterns in their shopping habits.
They found that when men bought diapers on Thursdays and Saturdays, they also had a 
strong tendency to buy beer. The grocery store could have used this valuable information 
to increase their profits. One thing they could have done – odd as it sounds – is move the
beer display closer to the diapers. Or, they could have simply made sure not to give any
discounts on beer on Thursdays and Saturdays. This is data mining in action – extracting meaningful
data from a huge data set.
